## Overview
Video Game Collections is a web application that allows users to create and manage their own video game lists. Users can create personalized lists, add games to their lists, and provide ratings and reviews for each game. This is only the Frontend UI project.\
\
The frontend is built using React. It leverages various libraries and tools to enhance the development process and provide a seamless user experience.

## Motivation

Web platforms like *letterboxd* provide users with the ability to create movie lists, add reviews, ratings, and other social media features. As an avid video game enjoyer, I noticed the absence of a similar platform dedicated to one of my favorite hobbies. To address this gap, I created Video Game Collections to offer a dedicated space to curate and share their gaming experiences.
